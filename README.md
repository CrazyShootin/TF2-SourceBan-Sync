# TF2-SourceBan-Sync
Hi my name is Crazy, this plugin handles Bans/Mutes/Gags issued from your SourceBan Panel once they are applied if the user is in-game they will be prompted a message that they have been Banned/Muted/Gagged then they will be promptly kicked. 
But it also notifies everyone in the Server who/why they have been Banned/Muted/Gagged + All prompts can be edited to as you wish.
